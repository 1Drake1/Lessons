               <p>1. Penguins are birds designed by evolution to swim, not fly. Their wings have evolved into
                  flippers,
                  and
                  although they usually walk straight on the ground, some fall onto their bellies to fly across the
                  ice.
                  Most species travel underwater at an average speed of 4-7 mph, but Gentoo can reach speeds of up to
                  22
                  mph.
               </p>
               <p>
                  2. All penguins live south of the equator. Although we often associate them with Antarctica, they
                  are
                  also found further north on the beaches and rocky shores of coastal South America, the Galapagos
                  Islands,
                  Australia and South Africa.
               </p>
               <p>
                  3. The oldest known species of penguin, the Waimanu Maningi, was discovered in New Zealand as a
                  62-million-year-old fossil. It was similar to an eider and had short wings designed for diving, but
                  not
                  for flying.
               </p>
               <p>4. The smallest penguin is the little blue or fairy penguin, which grows to just over two pounds
                  and
                  16
                  inches tall and is found in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

               <p>5. The largest known penguin of all time is Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi or the giant penguin, which
                  lived over 37 million years ago and stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 200 pounds. Its size
                  rival,
                  the New Zealand giant, originated about 30 million years ago, stood 5 feet tall and weighed about
                  130
                  pounds.</p>
